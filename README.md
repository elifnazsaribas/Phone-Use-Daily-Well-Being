# Phone-Use-Daily-Well-Being

## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of phone usage on sleep quality and productivity. Over two months, I will track my screen time, app usage, and notifications, comparing them with my sleep quality, deep sleep duration, and daily productivity score. The goal is to analyze patterns, test correlations, and understand how my phone habits influence daily well-being. Using data science techniques, I aim to make better decisions to improve my sleep and productivity

## Motivation
Smartphones are an essential part of modern life, but I’m not sure how they truly affect my sleep and productivity. This project aims to answer key questions:
- **Does using my phone late at night affect my sleep quality?**
- **Does excessive screen time reduce my productivity?**
- **Do constant notifications lead to distractions that lower my ability to complete tasks?**
- **Are certain types of apps (e.g., Social Media vs. Work Apps) more harmful to sleep or productivity?**

By tracking and analyzing my own daily habits, I want to find patterns, recognize any negative phone usage habits, and make small adjustments to sleep better and be more productive. This project is also a way to apply data science to a real-life situation and understand its impact on my well-being.

## Data Sources
This project relies on **my personal data collection** using:

###  **iOS Screen Time Data**  
- **Total Screen Time (min)** – Daily phone usage.
- **Night Phone Use (min)** – Time spent on phone after 10 PM.
- **Total Notifications** – Number of notifications received daily.
- **App Usage Breakdown** – Categorized as Social, Work, and Entertainment.

### **Apple Health & Apple Watch**  
- **Sleep Hours** – Total sleep duration from Apple Health.
- **REM (Deep Sleep) Duration** – Time spent in deep sleep.
- **Sleep Quality (1-10)** – My daily sleep quality I rate every morning.

### **Productivity**  
- **Productivity Score (%)** – Tasks Completed / Total Tasks × 100.
- **Mental Fatigue (1-10)** – Energy level at the end of the day.

### **Data Collection Method**
- iOS Screen Time will be recorded and exported into a spreadsheet daily.
- REM and total sleeping hours will be recorded by Apple Watch and exported into Apple Health.
- Self-reported productivity and focus levels will be logged in a spreadsheet at the end of each day.
- I will keep a to-do list each day and track how many tasks I complete, then calculate the percentage of tasks finished.
- Data will be cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.

## Planned Analysis  
After data collection, I will explore the relationships between phone usage and well-being. Possible methods include:  
- Identifying patterns in screen time and sleep.  
- Comparing days with high vs. low phone usage to see differences in well-being.  
- Looking for trends in app usage and its effect on productivity.  

The exact statistical methods will be determined after collecting enough data.

## Challenges & Limitations
- My ratings for sleep quality and mental fatigue are based on how I feel, which might not always be accurate.
- Sleep and productivity may be influenced by diet, exercise, or other habits.

## Expected Outcomes
By analyzing my data, I aim to answer:
- **Does late-night phone use reduce sleep quality?**
- **Is there a direct correlation between notifications and productivity loss?**
- **Does excessive screen time reduce my ability to complete daily tasks?**
- **Are certain types of phone usage (Social Media vs. Work Apps) more harmful than others?**

After finding answers to these questions I want to make better decisions about my screen time and daily habits.
